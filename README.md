# SLC2A3-primer
I'd like to update the SLC2A3 primer sequence.

I'm the first author of the paper published on BJC titled "Decreased vitamin C uptake mediated by SLC2A3 promotes leukemia progression and impedes TET2 restoration"

If you are trying to find a SLC2A3 primer, I wish this repository helps.

We updated our SLC2A3 primer, which has a better performance in qRT-PCR to detect the SLC2A3 mRNA expression level.

Primer sequence

HUMAN-SLC2A3-F: TATTGGCCTCTTCTGCGGAC (20 mer)

HUAMN-SLC2A3-R: GTAAAACCCAGTAGCAGCGG (20 mer)


HUMAN-GAPDH-F: CTCCTCCACCTTTGACGCTG (20 mer)

HUMAN-GAPDH-R: TCCTCTTGTGCTCTTGCTGG (20 mer)
